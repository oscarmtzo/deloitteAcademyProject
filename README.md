## Backend
### Spring JPA - Java Persistence API
It is basically a specification for accessing, persisting (not loosing data while stopping the execution of a  Java app) and / or managing data between Java Objects.

#### *Implementation of JPA through Hibernate*

It takes any java object and maps it to a Database using the concept of ORM (**O**bject **R**elational **M**apping).

An Example of that implementation is as follows:
- A Java class is represented as a SQL Table, therefore we can perfom CRUD (**C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete) operations.

```Spring Data JPA``` is an abstraction on top of ``JPA`` and ``Hibernate`` which makes easy to work with applications that needs access to ``database``, it gives us lots of SQL generated queries without having to write SQL code.
